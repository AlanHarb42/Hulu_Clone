# Hulu_Clone
I cloned the American streaming platform HULU, I've built it with Next.js and Tailwindcss, Content are server-side rendered so user experience is ridiculously fast, and Search engine optimization(SEO) friendly. I used an API to fetch trending movies/series and their descriptions, so content are dynamic and not fixed. The build is responsive(mobile friendly).
